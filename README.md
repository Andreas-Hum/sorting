### Sorting
This repo contains Javascript implementation of popular sorting algorithms.

All the implementations are guarenteed to work in browser and nodejs environments.

#### Conventions
1. File name should include the algorithm name. Eg: bubble sort's implemention will be named as bubble-sort.js
2. the test directory hosts two test cases for each implementation, one for browser and other for node.
